    Lets you compose objects into tree structures and then
    work with these structures as if they were individual objects

    Example: Products & Boxes - A box can contain several
    products as well as smaller boxes. These smaller boxes can hold
    products or even smaller boxes

    Suggests to create a common interface which dives
    deep into the contents of the tree
