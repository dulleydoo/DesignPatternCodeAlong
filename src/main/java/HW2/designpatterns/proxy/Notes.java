    /*
    -Lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object

    -Controls access to the original object, allowing u to perform something
    either before or after the request gets through to the original object

    -Suggests u create a new proxy class w/ the same interface as an original object

    -Benefits: If you need to execute something either before or after the primary
    logic of the class, the proxy lets you do this without changing that class
